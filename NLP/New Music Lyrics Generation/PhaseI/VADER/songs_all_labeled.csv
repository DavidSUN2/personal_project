My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin

Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out, yell out
You know the name, do gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib

Big brother was Big's Brother
Used to be Dame and Big's Brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum

My big Brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother

Who was hip hops brother

Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client, the presidito, Hola Hovito
The game getting foul, so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate español
No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um
A idol in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city, Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother

My big Brother was Bigs brother

About a lucky man who made the grade

He didn't notice that the lights had changed

The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon

So what really goes on
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
""Nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house
Trying to be White or a Jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an Uncle Tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are
You little punk, be true to the game

When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On MTV but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop selling out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'm a be brief
Be true to the game

You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the Negroes
You wanna be just like Jack
But Jack is calling you a nigger behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?

And shot dead

Away from the darkest door
But his luck it gave in
As the dawn light crept in
And he lay on the floor

With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear
To all of the men who have stood with no fear

A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone
One time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'cause if you is or you ain't a gang banger
Keep one in the chamber
'cause you'll get them things put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my hair grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my 9 anyway
For the day one of my homies want to squab
I'm still rollin wit The Lench Mob

(AmeriKKKa's most wanted)

Back in the day I dip my shirt in dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit, jack
Back to the criminals sect
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet
'cause I'm slick as slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweat hogs
And get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's most wanted

Hey yo, here's what the poster read:
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I feet first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube, a motherfuckin' clepto'
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'ma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America

(Hey yo Cube man, they on your ass)

Word, but who the fuck has heard?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank for the Caucasian
Cock the hammer then crackle, smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be
(What up G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'Cause the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin' the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it

I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - ""who is it?""
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table
Her brother came in he's into gangbangin'
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of good times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house
I got my coat and suddenly
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the patty wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object

First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass out
When I'm rollin' in a seven deuce glass house
The Mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us
Playing them old beats
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
Ready to peel your cap
You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax
Some say the Mob ain't positive
Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk
Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob

To be down with the Mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing
Cause if you testify you're living blind
Cause in the city you live and let die
Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might
My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""
So he soaked me up like Bounty
Had to do a week in the county
A piece of cake it was just like a party
Cause in the county you know everybody
No I didn't kill or steal or rob
Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob

If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob
Watch your step cause the gat is kept
In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she want to try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the Mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching
Now 235 is what I'm benching
But nowadays it's still not enough

The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon

Now I'm ready to mic it

Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm living, forgiven

As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em going in fear

Read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked

Still dropped a load

Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respects been giving how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record
And reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome

Subordinate terror
Kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone

Three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said drink up now it's gettin' on time to close
Richard, you haven't really changed, I said
It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs
You punched are dreaming

When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?

I think I've changed a lot since then, Do you?
Ideas that I'd held for years, emotional baggage, hopes and fears, 
Seen somehow in a different light, not as wrong , but not as right as they seemed before.
Was I different then?
Have I changed?
And will I change again?
I'm thinking of a mental free-fall, a partial total memory recall like what of the future, what of the past, what of the present will last?
And say I did forget and revert to the old days, forget this hurt.
Am I better off or in reverse, untaught by experience and therefore worse?
I mean a lot, I mean a little.
I mean a lot, I mean a little.

I'm like a coastline, a beach and spit.
Spurn Point and the rest of it.
The sea, the tide, the salt and foam.

Or maybe not, maybe my moment's gone.

I joined a fraternity organisation
Tucked in my shirt
Signed on the line
Right away they said about to improve my mind
The car I drove
The books I read
The food I ate
The booze I drank
The girls I took out
My breath

Said ""Kid, we don't much like the way you walk
And you gonna have to change the way you talk""
They said ""your dress is kind of sludge
And your attitude is mighty grudge""
Said ""you got to learn to bubble""
""You got to bubble with enthusiasm"" I started bubble
""Most important thing you can't forget
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet""
I never did really understand
That that's gonna make me anymore a man
But I learned it
I can whip through that Son-of-a-beta backwards in five seconds
Then they hit me with some pretty bad news
Concerning the payment of monthly dues
I never did know where that money went
I never was sure it was well spent
But I paid it
I'm no trouble causer and besides I figured that's life
If you want good friends it gonna cost you

I got a great big old jug of wine
I went back to the house in about an hour
When the boy's were drinking whiskey sours
Brandy Alexanders
Frozen daquires
Reciting the Greek alphabet to one another

I could see I was gonna have to do my very best
To get myself out of that fraternity mess

When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""

Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""daddy-o don't you dare""

Give me fever with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story, here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn

Go to the bank and the hardware store, put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin', that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate but cuttin' the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks I can't take to my grave

Blowing everybody's circuits
Girls like that bring a lump to m pocket
Everybody says I can never get her

But I never was a quitter I'm a born fighter
I've gotta wriggle for my will now
I'm a born fighter
How I hate it on a plate

Shoe shopping,
lapping up the grooms and uppers
I don't want to have to get
Another pair of hush puppies
I keep on looking at 47-each

Well in between the pages
of the glossy magazines
There's a coffee table world
I could never ever fit in
I shout about how I could never buy it
But I stand up and fight
For the right to go and try it
I'm a born fighter
I've gotta wriggle for my will now

944,Beastie Boys,humorous,Paul's Boutique,/album/pauls-boutique-mw0000199269,"There's a girl over there
With long brown hair
I took her to the place
I threw the mattress in her face
Took off her shirt
Took off her bra
Took off her pants
You know what I saw?

Right about now I'd like to dedicate this song out to my main homie Mike D
Get on the mic, g-get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike

Let's be real and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are dope an M.C. you must listen to
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you
Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to
You say fuck that yo Holmes fuck this
I'm the king Ad-Whammy you're Dick Butkus
One-half science and another half soul
His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
Got busy in Frisco fooled around in Fresno
Got over on your girlie cause you know she never says no

J-just get on the mic, just get on the mic
G-get on the mic, get on the mic Mike

Well, Mike D. is a special individual
Pulling out knots and pulling in residuals
Go to the movies get the Rolos
The cholos riding slow and low
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo
Mike my stromie don't be so selfish
Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish

It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the Dr. Hfuhruhurr Ale
I've got nothing to lose so I'm pissin' on the third rail
Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station
D-Train ride to Coney Island vacation
Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstile I lost my last token
Ride between the cars pissing, smoking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy ""yo put that crack out""
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Party people going places on the D-Train

Stop that train, I wanna get on

Check it
Trench-coat wingtip going to work
And you'll be pulling a train like Captain Kirk
Pickpocket gangsters paying their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes' spandex caught in the slide doors
Now you're tuck between the stations
And it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
Fifty-dollar fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise your Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin'
Friday night and Jamaica Queen's funkin'
Elevated platform never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin' El Diario
Riding the train down from El Barrio
Went from the station straight to Orange Julius
I brought a hot dog from who - George Drakoulias

M.C. for what I am and do
The A is for Adam and the lyrics, true
So as pray and hope and the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because I'm down with the three, the unstoppable three
Me and Adam and D. were born to M.C.
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you recited
Arrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted
Enter the arena as I take center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special
For I am a bard but not the last one
I'm am the king and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass

I drop the L. when I'm skiing
I'm smoking and peaking
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Can't stop the mind-fuck when it's rolling along
Can't stop the smooth runnin' when the shit's running strong
Broke my bindings, the lion with wings
Preaching his word in the B. Boy sing
I am one with myself as I turn to thee
Prefer the dreams to reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week, or for a year, or for a year and a day
Come what may

I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors 'cause the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day
And I am going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody were testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages
Is, was and always shall be
Check the prophetic sections of the pages

He's in line for the Disco Day

Hello Brooklyn

New York, New York, it's a hell of a town
You know the Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down
Because they don't know my name they only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job, I cut my hair
You know I cut my boss 'cause I don't care
You tried to get slick, you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold-finger knuckle
'Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off
I'm a Buffalo Soldier, broader than Broadway
Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
'Cause I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza
If you ask a question you will get the answer
Her breast I saw I reached I felt
M-O-N-E-Y, the belt
I stay at home just like a hermit
I got the jammy but I don't got the permit
You know why?
You got a boyfriend and his name is Slick Nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick
I ride around town 'cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in Brooklyn
Just to watch him die

He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
She's slippin' through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost

Well if your world was all black and if your world was all white
Well then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right
Nicknamed Shamrock but my name is not Shamus
Girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous
My name is not O'Houigheighi nor is it Brian
If I said that I was weak now, you know I'd be lyin'
Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it

You explain to a musician, they know it but they can't do it

I got Chinese eyes and Chinese suits
Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots
More updated on the hip-hop lingo
My favorite New York Knick was Hawthorne Wingo
Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card
Man, you know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte
Peepin' out the colors I be buggin' on Cezanne
They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man
Your face turns red as your glass of wine
That you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time
You should be with me, you should drop that bum
'Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Striped Gum
With that big round butt of yours
I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin'
Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'

Here's another one for y'all to peep
It's called M-I-K-E on the M-I-C

I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster
Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way then they're going to finish me
You might know this but you've never been this see
If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like Raymond Burr
I'm so high that they call me Your Highness
So if you don't know me then pardon my shyness
I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it

Out on the sea in a great big boat

To stroke the oars that drive our galleons on
And while we rowed we had our song
And we had our god, and it may seem odd
But at least there was a cause

Caught a wind and we upped the sail
Lost two ships when it turned to a gale
Down went a third when she rammed on a whale
Though we despaired we could not fail

And through it all we never faltered

Give you strength that you might wield
A Viking sword and a Viking shield

Layin' bricks or layin' pipe.
I don't stand out in a crowd;
Just look like one of the guys.
Little do they know,
When I'm alone in bed at night,
I become the King of the Silver Screen.

I stare at the ceiling there;
I know where I belong.
I two step with Fred Astaire or
Fighting old King Kong.
I can be any hero at all;
Zorro or Don Juan.
I know I'm the King of the Silver Screen.

Hollywood movies keep flashin' across my mind.
I could've been Valentino if I was born in another time.

I might be solving a case or swinging from a tree.
Share a joke with Crosby and Hope;
We're such good friends, you see.
Even dazzle the Academy with my versatility.
'Cause I'm the King of the Silver Screen.

Hollywood movies keep flashin' across my mind.
I could've been Errol Flynn
If I was born in another time.

I could've been a star.
I could've been a star.
I could've played that part.
But Hollywood movies keep flashin' before my eyes.
I could've been Greta Garbo
If I was born in another time.

I wake the very next day
Go on back to work.
I'm just a face in a crowd;
Another average jerk.
And all the guys on the building site look at me flirt.
Because I'm the Queen of the Silver.

Yes, I'm the Queen of the Silver Screen.
I admit it to all my fellow workers.
I don't care any more. I'm tired of closets.
I'm gonna eat my makeup for lunch today.
Just stop hittin' me again. All right guys?
I'm going to Hollywood to be a starlet.
I know I'm 240 pounds and play center
For the Detroit Lions.
I don't care any more.
I like makeup and dresses and Hollywood.
I'll make somebody a great little wife.

962,N.W.A,humorous,Straight Outta Compton,/album/straight-outta-compton-mw0000653426,"Yo man there's a lot of brothers out there 
Flaking and perpetrating but scared to kick reality

Man, you been doing all this dope producing
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

So what you want me to do?
(Express yourself!)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, while I'm dropping English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nothing
But making a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)
(Express yourself!)
(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)

Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend; the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessing or guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go looking for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)
(Express yourself!)
(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)

(Express yourself!)  from the heart
Cause if you want to start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wessun for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob!
Yes I'ma climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doing damage
Or I'ma be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're getting hyped tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just (Express yourself!)

my hair done?] How short's your hair right now?
[Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails
done too] Look, I'ma tell you like this

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin' up in 'em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See they think we narrow minded
Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin?""
See I'm only down for screwin, but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
Cause if they catch you slippin', you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're gettin' their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messin' with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube girl, cause I ain't the one

[Girl, you got to get these brothers for all the money
you can honey. Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't
do nothin for me but get out of my face]

[I know what you mean girl, it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off
unless he got dollars]

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's gettin' juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
Cause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me
You know I spell girl with a be
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin' out
Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster huh? I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

[I don't care how they look if they got money
we can hook up but they ain't gettin none.]

[Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some
play up they mind a lil bit, and get that money.]


Give you money why bother
Cause you know I'm lookin' nothin' like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave em and love and stay above em
I used to get no play now she stay behind me
Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used
But I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it
Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

I don't see no rings on this finger
Yeah you love my money, I got what I wanted, beat it",[ ice cube think could give money get hair ] short hair right [ well know get every week need nail ] look ama tell like not one one get play like

 as she came riding through the dark;
 no moon to keep her armour bright,
 no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.
 She said, ""I'm tired of the war,
 I want the kind of work I had before,
 a wedding dress or something white
 to wear upon my swollen appetite.""

 Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
 you know I've watched you riding every day
 and something in me yearns to win
 such a cold and lonesome heroine.
 ""And who are you?"" she sternly spoke
 to the one beneath the smoke.
 ""Why, I'm fire,"" he replied,
 ""And I love your solitude, I love your pride.""

 ""Well then fire, make your body cold,
 I'm gonna give you mine to hold,""
 saying this she climbed inside
 to be his one, to be his only bride.
 And deep into his fiery heart
 he took the dust of Joan of Arc,
 and high above all these wedding guests
 he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.

 It was deep into his fiery heart
 he took the dust of Joan of Arc,
 and then she clearly understood
 if he was fire, oh she must be wood.

 I saw the glory in her eye.

A tone of plea for everything you get

Of my fault, I don't call a spade
Ask he said, ask for what you need
Don't be shy, shyness is a little girl
And I feel if you're scolded like a child
All your elders, were once scolded too
We're just
No eyes, just ends

Don't you care ---- just pull in
Ask he said, it's how you get advice
And more than that it's talking to them
There is magic but really there's no magic
In what appears
I get quiet, I feel it all the while
No one's touched me for such a long time
And I get wounds she bathes them in salt
Never to open lightning with a bolt
Ask he said, and don't ever suppose
If you don't ask then nobody knows
We're just
Some eyes it's not
Were just old friends
