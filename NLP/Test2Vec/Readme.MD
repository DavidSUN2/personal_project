1. The folder 'test2vec1' stores code and files for the first experiment in my project report:
	>> the subdirectory 'models' stores vectors for each test case' name which I have generated and can be used for analogy
	>> the subdirectories 'my_train_dir', 'my_val_dir' and 'my_test_dir' stores training dataset, validation dataset and test dataset
	>> if you want to replicate this experiment from scratch, please run 0main_code.ipynb
	>> if you want to tune hyperparameters, please check common.py


2. The folder 'test2vec2' stores code and files for the second experiment in my project report:
	>> the subdirectory 'data_part1' and 'data_part2' stores vectors for four selected classes' names which I have generated and can be used directly
	>> the subdirectories 'my_train_dir', 'my_val_dir' and 'my_test_dir' stores training dataset, validation dataset and test dataset
	>> if you want to replicate this experiment from scratch, please run 0main_code.ipynb
	>> if you want to tune hyperparameters, please check common.py
	>> the subdirectory 'newPlan_preprocess' stores code and files for data preprocessing including two folders 'testsuite' and 'testsuite2' which store Randoop-generated test cases and have been renamed with classes' names and are used for training and validation respectively


3. I run the codes through Google Colab. About code2vec, please check the old (and robust) version: https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec/tree/9789cfa0d7ee74b8dca9e2b84c45228b86716d1c
